                <h3>Redesigning a Website </h3>
                <p>
                    For my UIUX course, I was tasked to redesign a public website to improve usability and design for accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rhode Island's <a href="http://www.oceanstatehearing.com" target="_blank">
                    Ocean State Hearing Aid Center</a> has been in service helping those with 
                    auditory impairment for over four decades. However, its website has not 
                    caught up with its age. I wanted to do a website redesign in celebration 
                    of its 45 years of service. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-text" id="research">
                <h3>Assessing Usability Issues</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    &emsp;Approximately one in three people between the ages of 65 
                    and 74 suffers from hearing loss.
                </div>
                <p>
                    With this in mind, it's no doubt that Ocean State Hearing often 
                    takes care of and interacts with more elderly folks. Looking at the 
                    original website however, I noticed a lot of dated design choices that may 
                    cause some confusion and difficulty in accessing the needed information,
                    especially for customers who are not as accustomed to computer technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the key problems I noticed:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            The navigation bar doesn't float along with the reader 
                            to the bottom of the page, meaning on longer pages, 
                            if a reader wants to go back to the home page halfway 
                            through reading something, they have to scroll all 
                            the way back up to the top.
                        </li>
                        <li>The text-size also doesn't readjust on smaller screens, 
                            making the website nearly impossible to read or click
                             on anything on a tablet or a phone.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The color of the headers also blends together with 
                            the beige color of the background. It doesn't nearly 
                            stand out as much as the black text.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="main-text" id="process">
                <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
                <p>
                    Using my observations, I created a few wireframes and prototypes for what my redesign of the website would look like. 
                    During this process, I wanted to make sure it was absolutely easy to learn and navigate,
                    as well as accessible to as many people as possible. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The buttons needed to be large, easily readable and clickable. I made
                    sure to make them responsive as well, so that they had different states
                    depending on whether the mouse was hovering over them or clicking them,
                    as that would indicate to the user clearly that it was interactable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, the interface was a little more simple than I would have preferred, 
                    but I felt it was necessary to prioritize learnability in a medical website
                    over graphics and color.
                </p>
                <h4>LoFi Wireframe</h4>
                <p>
                    Designed and sketched in Krita using a drawing tablet. I drew
                    three iterations of what the site would look like on three different
                    devices/monitors.

                <p>
                    Using my lofi wireframes, I created some prototypes using Figma, 
                    demonstrating how the page 
                    hierarchy would be formatted, as well as key features such as 
                    color and font-choices. 
                </p>
                <p>

                    A style guide I made to help me map out what the buttons would look like 
                    in different states. I specifically wanted the link-pages and menu buttons 
                    to be as responsive as possible, making it easier for users to determine 
                    what parts of the page they can interactive and which parts they cannot.
