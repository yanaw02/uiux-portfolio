                <h3>Understanding the Persona</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most important aspects of creating an interface that exists in a public space is to consider what kind of persona would use this interface.
                    <br><br>
                    For my UIUX course assignment, I take a look at a Kiosk at one of the local bubble tea shops in my area and try to determine the user profile of someone who this product is designed for through a series of interviews, observations, empathy maps, and a storyboard.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-text" id="analysis">
                <img src="assets/kiosk/sketch.png" alt="" style="width:80%;margin: 0 10%;object-fit: cover;">
                <h3>Understanding the Product</h3>
                <p>The kiosk consists of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a touchscreen application from which you can make orders with</li>
                    <li>a card reader allowing for payment</li>
                    <li>a menu page detailing the availability, cost, and photographs of 
                    each drink for the user to scroll through. </li>
                    <li> a drink page allows the user to heavily customize their orders based on 
                    things such as ice level, sugar level, quantity, etc, detailing the cost 
                    and contents of these customizations, as well as allowing for the user 
                    to input special requests. </li>
                    <li> a payment page  where the user can choose their tip </li>
                    <li> a phone number page requires a number to process payment </li>
                    <li> users can also link their Snackpass and receive rewards</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It specifically exists as an alternative method for tea-lovers to make 
                    purchases at the shop, making the ordering process more streamlined, 
                    efficient, and customizable. It also allows for employees to focus on 
                    creating the drinks rather than tending to orders. 
                    <br><br>
                    When their order is ready, the application automatically messages the 
                    number associated with the order for the customer to pick up, allowing 
                    for increased customer mobility and order accuracy as well.

                <h3>Researching the Persona</h3>
                <p>
                    To properly understand the type of users this kiosk was designed for, 
                    I conducted a few short interviews on some colleagues and friends 
                    upon asking them to order something at the kiosk. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Given the fact that the store is located on a college campus, and that 
                    most of the people I could find here were college students, there is 
                    slightly less variation and diversity in my data collection than 
                    I would have liked. However, given the circumstances, here are some of 
                    the key observations I found of my users.
                </p>
                <h4>Key Observations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>All users scrolled around to explored items and customizations for their drinks.
                        Few ended up spending quite some time to consider what to order while some 
                        others clicked though and were very fast with their familiar orders. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Users actively chose to customize their orders.</li>
                    <li>No one walked away when it was required the purchase be paid with card.</li>
                    <li>Some hesitated at the reqiurement to put down their phone number.</li>
                    <li>Few left a small tip.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Outside of these passively perceived observations, all 3 users also 
                    responded to my interview questions. The stated questions and summarized 
                    responses are here below.
                </p>
                <h4>Interview Summary</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>How do you feel using the kiosk?</b>
                        <br>
                        All interviewees responded that the interface was very 
                        bright and easy to navigate and understand. If anything, 
                        the users who were new to using the kiosk reported it 
                        took a bit for them to read through everything, but 
                        otherwise throught the device was efficient.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>On average, how often would you prefer using the kiosk over ordering at the counter?</b>
                        <br>
                        Certain interviewees prefered using the Kiosk over 
                        ordering at the counter as it gave them more control 
                        over their orders. Others preferred it because they 
                        preferred not to talk to people.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>What was on your mind when you were using the kiosk?</b>
                        <br>
                        Everyone was just concerned with picking their order.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>What's something you would change about the kiosk?</b>
                        <br>
                        Many complained about the touchscreen having blips. One 
                        particular user did not like that he was required to enter 
                        his phone number, as he was afraid of getting promotional spam.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="main-text" id="result">
                <h3>Creating the Persona</h3>
                <p>
                    With the information I have gathered in mind, I created two 
                    personas for the users of this kiosk, one named Beth, and 
                    another named John.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have also made a storyboard for Beth, detailing her 
                    supposed experience using the kiosk, at the very end of the page.

                    <div style="background-color: #8FE5FF; width:100%; padding: 5%;">
                        <h2 class="emph">BETH</h2>
                        <h5>Description</h5>
                            Beth is a hardworking young adult who just ended a 
                            long day of work meetings, and just wants to get a 
                            drink or a snack before she goes home to recharge 
                            her social battery.
                        
                        <h5>Problems Encountered</h5>
                            The touchscreen is not always responsive. Beth struggles 
                            with punching in the buttons and feels pressured by the 
                            growing line of people behind her. She struggles between 
                            asking for an employee's help and her social anxiety.
                        <h5>Why is Beth a representative persona?</h5>

                            Beth is clearly a younger, more shy, more tech-savvy 
                            young adult who prefers the comfort, freedom, and privacy 
                            of using the kiosk over ordering at the counter. At the 
                            kiosk, she's under no pressure to answer questions for 
                            her order immediately and can do some exploration with 
                            shop items.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div style="width:80%; height:fit-content; padding: 10%">
                    <div>
                        <img src="assets/kiosk/empathy_john.png" style="width:100%; object-fit:cover;">
                    </div>
                    <div style="background-color: #8FE5FF; width:100%; padding: 5%;">
                        <h2 class="emph">JOHN</h2>
                        <h5>Description</h5>
                            John is a college-aged student who has classes to 
                            attend in 15 minutes and he knows exactly what drink 
                            he usually needs to get him through his day.

                        <h5>Problems Encountered</h5>
                            John is in a rush. His order is specific and long, 
                            and the application sometimes can glitch out or fail 
                            to sense his inputs, causing him to lose precious 
                            time as if he accidentally clicks through it, he has 
                            to go back and restart his mistake. He's frustrated 
                            that he has to rush and can't just say his order, 
                            which would be faster.

                        <h5>Why is John a representative persona?</h5>
                            Like Beth, John is also a younger adult who has 
                            experience with online shopping and is very comfortable 
                            with using a digital interface and getting drinks to go 
                            on the road. His long and specific order can sometimes 
                            confuse staff and cause them to make mistakes. However, 
                            with a digital interface which records specific choices, 
                            he has more control over what he wants through the kiosk.
