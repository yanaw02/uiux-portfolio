                <h3>The Iterative Design Process</h3>
                <p>
                    For this assignment, I worked in a team of 4 to select a startup 
                    company and iteratively design an interactive mockup for their 
                    web application. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to better understand and learn the design process, 
                    what it entailed, and gain experience working through the 
                    troubles and difficulties that my team and I faced. We looked 
                    though a list of startups and ended up selecting the one which 
                    caught our eye the most:
                </p>
                <a href="https://rubbrband.com/" target="_blank" style="margin:0 20%;width: 60%; height:fit-content;display:flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; justify-content:center; align-content: center;">
                    <h2>RubbrBand</h2>
                    <img src="assets/rubbrband/Rubberband.png" alt="" style="object-fit:cover;">

                <h4>
                    The Startup
                </h4>
                <div class="quote">
                    &emsp;RubbrBand allows you to train models with zero setup, directly off of 
                    open-source models on GitHub.
                </div>
                <p>
                    RubbrBand provides a web interface for extracting code 
                    repositories and reporting dependency information relating to 
                    machine learning. Users of this application can upload a link 
                    to projects in github and have this app perform a full scan 
                    of what packages will be needed within their environment to
                    build and manage their project.

                    As many of us in the group were familiar with and had struggled 
                    with the complicated process of setting up neural networks and 
                    machine learning models firsthand, we were really curious about 
                    the product RubbrBand was developping, and worked hard to make 
                    an interface that would help them address some of the issues 
                    of machine learning.

                <h3>Feedback and Improvements</h3>
                <p>
                    We had two iterations of receiving feedback and critiques for 
                    improvements. The first was done in our course, during our studio 
                    hours where our peers looked through our project and provided 
                    comments. The other is when we submitted our prototype to UserTesting 
                    with explicit tasks and received video feedback.
                </p>
                <h4>Studio Critiques</h4>
                <p>
                    When receiving our studio critique, we obtained some valuable 
                    feedback which was then used to improve our design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, 
                    people thought the training page should have more variation 
                    when it comes to colors to better represent the states of training, 
                    and there were also some reused colors that made some actions 
                    confusing. Users did like the use of red for the stop button to 
                    emphasize the consequences associated with pressing it given 
                    how long training models can take. 
                    The color scheme mostly 
                    received positive feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were some suggestions to improve contrast with Github 
                    logos on the training dashboard, and a way to identify which 
                    page in the side menu the user is currently on. Some comments were in 
                    regards to the help page and how the format and hierarchy was 
                    not consistent, some of the items were redundant with the FAQ 
                    section.  Users also thought it would be nice to have a way 
                    to visualize the time remaining in training instead of a 
                    percentage as training time can vary 
                    a lot depending on many factors.
                </p>
                <div class="quote">
                    &emsp;Overall, 
                    users liked the layout and visual design, but had some comments regarding buttons 
                    not being uniform and the text sizes differing. </div>
                <p>
                    In the end, we made a lot of changes to our prototype based on 
                    these critiques, adding more interactivity, showing the progress 
                    through more visual means, cleaning up the hierarchy and making 
                    everything consistent. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Once we felt we were ready to move on, we submitted our Figma 
                    prototype to UserFeedback.
                </p>
                <h4>UserFeedback Critiques</h4>
                <p>
                    For our UserFeedback submission, we included tasks we asked 
                    the users to complete on our prototype. These tasks being:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>logging in</li>
                        <li>checking what features they currently have access to under the gold subscription</li>
                        <li>checking the status of a CNN they have already uploaded</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    This provides a pretty comprehensive walkthrough of almost 
                    every screen in our hifi, with the one exception being the 
                    upload page, which was not interactive and thus could not 
                    really be tested thoroughly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All users were successful in completing these tasks and rated 
                    them quite easy. You can see their recorded interactions 
                    here:

                    One aspect we would like to improve is 
                    to make it easier to see which features a user currently has 
                    access to. Currently, users only can view their features by 
                    going to the "Upgrade" screen, which a couple users described 
                    as unintuitive. One user suggested to change this word to 
                    "Subscription" so that users checking their current subscription 
                    and users wishing to upgrade would both click there intuitively. 
                    Another user suggested having current features visible on the 
                    profile screen.

                <h3>Final Product</h3>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, feedback and collaboration were integral to
                    success on this project. It was very useful to be able to 
                    learn from classmates who critiqued our interface and then
                    decide as a team how we want to implement changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was also an important step to be able to get user feedback
                    from UserTesting.com which gave us insight from anonymous 
                    users on how people would react when using our design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, it was an exciting last step to be able to actually
                    contact this startup and share our work with them to see what
                    they think. It will be very interesting to see how this company
                    reacts to the design we made for the interface of their application.
