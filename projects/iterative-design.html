                <h3>The Iterative Design Process</h3>
                <p>
                    For this assignment, I worked in a team of 4 to select a startup 
                    company and iteratively design an interactive mockup for their 
                    web application. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to better understand and learn the design process, 
                    what it entailed, and gain experience working through the 
                    troubles and difficulties that my team and I faced. We looked 
                    though a list of startups and ended up selecting the one which 
                    caught our eye the most:
                </p>
                <a href="https://rubbrband.com/" target="_blank" style="margin:0 20%;width: 60%; height:fit-content;display:flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; justify-content:center; align-content: center;">
                    <h2>RubbrBand</h2>
                    <img src="assets/RubbrBand/Rubberband.png" alt="" style="object-fit:cover;">
                </a>
                <h3>
                    The Startup
                </h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    &emsp;RubbrBand allows you to train models with zero setup, directly off of 
                    open-source models on GitHub.
                </div>
                <p>
                    RubbrBand provides a web interface for extracting code 
                    repositories and reporting dependency information relating to 
                    machine learning. Users of this application can upload a link 
                    to projects in github and have this app perform a full scan 
                    of what packages will be needed within their environment to
                    build and manage their project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As many of us in the group were familiar with and had struggled 
                    with the complicated process of setting up neural networks and 
                    machine learning models firsthand, we were really curious about 
                    the product RubbrBand was developping, and worked hard to make 
                    an interface that would help them address some of the issues 
                    of machine learning.

                <h3>Feedback and Improvements</h3>
                <p>
                    We had two iterations of receiving feedback and critiques for 
                    improvements. The first was done in our course, during our studio 
                    hours where our peers looked through our project and provided 
                    comments. The other is when we submitted our prototype to UserTesting 
                    with explicit tasks and received video feedback.
                </p>
                <h4>Studio Critiques</h4>
                <p>
                    When receiving our studio critique, we obtained some valuable 
                    feedback which was then used to improve our design. 
                </p>
                <div class="quote">
                    &emsp;Overall, 
                    users liked the layout and visual design, but had some comments regarding buttons 
                    not being uniform and the text sizes differing. </div>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, 
                    people thought the training page should have more variation 
                    when it comes to colors to better represent the states of training, 
                    and there were also some reused colors that made some actions 
                    confusing. Users did like the use of red for the stop button to 
                    emphasize the consequences associated with pressing it given 
                    how long training models can take. 
                    The color scheme mostly 
                    received positive feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were some suggestions to improve contrast with Github 
                    logos on the training dashboard, and a way to identify which 
                    page in the side menu the user is currently on. Some comments were in 
                    regards to the help page and how the format and hierarchy was 
                    not consistent, some of the items were redundant with the FAQ 
                    section.  Users also thought it would be nice to have a way 
                    to visualize the time remaining in training instead of a 
                    percentage as training time can vary 
                    a lot depending on many factors.
