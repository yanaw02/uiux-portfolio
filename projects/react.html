                <h3>Using React</h3>
                <p>
                    I have always loved playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, 
                    however, sometimes with the amount of magic items that our players 
                    receive, the inventory gets a bit hectic and we lose track of which 
                    items are attunement, which heal, and which are more utility based.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given all of that, I decided to make a little magic item card sorter 
                    using React! 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-text" id="planning">
                <h3>Planning Functionalities and Design</h3>
                <p>
                    To be able to quickly access magic items with certain properties, 
                    I needed some sort of way to filter and sort the items. Furthermore, 
                    I think it'd be useful to be able to mark down certain magic items 
                    into a list of references, so players can pull it up quickly. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Dungeons and Dragons, magic items can be sorted by their 
                    cost in gold, their rarity, or simply their name. They can be 
                    consumable potions or oils, weapons, or just artifacts. They 
                    can heal, turn you into a giant creature, let you walk on walls, 
                    and give you permenant buffs!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I would have liked to include all of those features, 
                    I ended up having only two layerable filtering methods, one 
                    which filters only the items with the intersection of all tags, and 
                    one which filters out the union.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-text" id="process">
                <h3>Components and Interactions</h3>
                <p>
                    The most visually representative way to allow the user to interact 
                    with the interfact was to simply have the different sorting 
                    function options be represented by a radio button, and the filtering 
                    options be represented by a checkbox. The aggregate of adding 
                    items to an inventory can be done with a button on each item card.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created a component for a magic item card ported from a json file, 
                    which allows me to easily add or delete items in the whole list, 
                    as well as a component for each filtering and sorting option.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-text" id="result" style="margin-bottom: 2%;">
                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>
                    And with that, I created my Dungeons and Dragons magic item 
                    reference sorter! The code is here for anyone to quickly use 
                    and access. I hope this helps for anyone who plays DnD as much 
                    as I do!
