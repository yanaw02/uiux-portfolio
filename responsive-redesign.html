                <h3>Redesigning a Website </h3>
                <p>
                    For my UIUX course, I was tasked to redesign a public website to improve usability and design for accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rhode Island's <a href="http://www.oceanstatehearing.com" target="_blank">
                    Ocean State Hearing Aid Center</a> has been in service helping those with 
                    auditory impairment for over four decades. However, its website has not 
                    caught up with its age. I wanted to do a website redesign in celebration 
                    of its 45 years of service. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-text" id="research">
                <h3>Assessing Usability Issues</h3>
                <p style="font-size:20px; margin: 0 5%;line-height:30px;">
                    &emsp;Approximately one in three people between the ages of 65 
                    and 74 suffers from hearing loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this in mind, it's no doubt that Ocean State Hearing often 
                    takes care of and interacts with more elderly folks. Looking at the 
                    original website however, I noticed a lot of dated design choices that may 
                    cause some confusion and difficulty in accessing the needed information,
                    especially for customers who are not as accustomed to computer technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the key problems I noticed:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>The navigation bar doesn't float along with the reader to the bottom of the page, meaning on longer pages, if a reader wants to go back to the home page halfway through reading something, they have to scroll all the way back up to the top.</li>
                        <li>The text-size also doesn't readjust on smaller screens, making the website nearly impossible to read or click on anything on a tablet or a phone, which older folks with hearing issues are more likely to use over computers.</li>
                        <li>I also found myself struggling with the random bolded lines in the text that emphasize the wrong words and add very little meaning to the website. Rather than finding myself convinced and secure in their company, it just made reading the information harder, as I find my eyes being pulled towards them thinking they're an address or something, only to find that it is the words "trust in the experts".</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Responsive Redesign</h3>
                <p>
                    With the prototypes I've designed above, I've recreated the 
                    website to be more accessible and usable for 
                    people of all kinds of different backgrounds.
