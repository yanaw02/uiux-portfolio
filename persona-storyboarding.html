                <h3>Understanding the Persona</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most important aspects of creating an interface that exists in a public space is to consider what kind of persona would use this interface.
                    <br><br>
                    For my UIUX course assignment, I take a look at a Kiosk at one of the local bubble tea shops in my area and try to determine the user profile of someone who this product is designed for through a series of interviews, observations, empathy maps, and a storyboard.

            <div class="main-text">
                <h3>Understanding the Product</h3>
                <p>The kiosk consists of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a touchscreen application from which you can make orders with</li>
                    <li>a card reader allowing for payment</li>
                    <li>a menu page: detailing the availability, cost, and photographs of 
                    each drink for the user to scroll through. </li>
                    <li> drink page: allows the user to heavily customize their orders based on 
                    things such as ice level, sugar level, quantity, etc, detailing the cost 
                    and contents of these customizations, as well as allowing for the user 
                    to input special requests. </li>
                    <li> payment page: user can choose tip </li>
                    <li> a phone number page: requires a number to process payment </li>
                    <li> users can also link their Snackpass and receive rewards</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It specifically exists as an alternative method for tea-lovers to make 
                    purchases at the shop, making the ordering process more streamlined, 
                    efficient, and customizable. It also allows for employees to focus on 
                    creating the drinks rather than tending to orders. 
                    <br><br>
                    When their order is ready, the application automatically messages the 
                    number associated with the order for the customer to pick up, allowing 
                    for increased customer mobility and order accuracy as well.
